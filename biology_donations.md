# Biology Donations



 ### **Donations/Gifts**

When someone calls in and wants to give the Biology department a “Gift/Donation” i.e. insect collection, a taxidermy mount, a cadaver (or they want to donate their own body for science), etc. these situations should be directed through the Philanthropic Office.
