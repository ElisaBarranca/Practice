#How can I install iSeries?

If you are an employee, please follow the steps in [iSeries for Full-Time Employees] (https://td.byui.edu/TDClient/79/ITHelpCenter/KB/ArticleDet?ID=12080) or [iSeries for Student Employees] (https://td.byui.edu/TDClient/79/ITHelpCenter/KB/ArticleDet?ID=12068) to download iSeries, depending on what type of employee you are. If you would like to access iSeries though VDI instead of downloading it, please follow the steps in [iSeries in VDI](https://td.byui.edu/TDClient/79/ITHelpCenter/KB/ArticleDet?ID=11680).
