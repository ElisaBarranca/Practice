#How can I install iSeries?

If you are an employee, please follow the steps in iSeries for Full-Time Employees or iSeries for Student Employees to download iSeries, depending on what type of employee you are. If you would like to access iSeries though VDI instead of downloading it, please follow the steps in [iSeries in VDI](https://td.byui.edu/TDClient/79/ITHelpCenter/KB/ArticleDet?ID=11680).
